Support layer for using Yocto and BeagleBone


As of Yocto 1.6, BeagleBone is officially 'supported'. However, some of the functionality is missing.

This layer attempts to provide some of the missing functionality from meta-beagleboard layer &  RobertNelson's kernel-devel repo.

Recipes are tested with Beagle Bone Black Rev C.
